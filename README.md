# MECH Web Application

## Overview

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- **css/style.css**: The stylesheet file that contains the styling for the web page.
- **img/**: This directory contains images used in the web application.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that includes the jQuery code for the loader and fade-in effects.

## Usage

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MECH-web-app.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Dependencies

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): The web application relies on jQuery for the loader and fade-in effects. The jQuery library is included from a CDN.

## How to Customize

- **Logo**: Replace the logo image files in the `img/` directory with your own logo.
- **Styles**: Modify the styles in the `css/style.css` file to match your design preferences.
- **URLs**: Update the `href` attributes in the login and register buttons to point to the desired URLs.
